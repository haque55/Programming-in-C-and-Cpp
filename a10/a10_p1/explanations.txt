a) Comment out the using namespace std; and then take your time, read and 
interpret the error messages.

Explanation: The compiler produces a set of errors due to missing the namespace
before objects.
It outputs that "string", "cout" and "endl" weren't declared in the scope.
Objects "string", "cout" and "endl" declared inside a namespace block are placed
in a named scope that prevents them from being mistaken for identically-named 
symbols in other scopes. Therefore we can only use these objects, that are 
defined inside of the std namespace, we need to prepend "std::" to each 
"string", "cout" and "endl" found inside Critter.cpp

b) Also remove the Critter:: prefix in one of the methods in Critter.cpp, 
read and interpret the error message.

Removed Critter:: before setName method
Explanation: The compiler produces an error saying that "name" was not defined 
in the scope.
"name" is a private data member of the Critter class, defined in Critter.h
When implementing a method for a class it is not necessary to use the selection 
operator to call methods of the same class or to access data members.
In our case we haven't specified the class our method belongs to.
Therefore we can't access the class' other methods or data members.
We have to prepend "Critter::" to the method definition or write the 
method definition inside header file or make the data member public.
