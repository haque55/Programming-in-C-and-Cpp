This is a story of long ago. At that time the 
languages and letters were quite different from 
ours of today. English is used to represent the 
languages. But two points may be noted. (1) In 
English the only correct plural of dwarf is dwarfs, 
and the adjective is dwarfish. In this story 
dwarves and dvarvish are used-, but only when 
speaking of the ancient people to whom Thorin 
Oakenshield and his companions belonged. (2) 
Ore is not an English word. It occurs in one or 
two places but is usually translated goblin (or 
hobgoblin for the larger kinds). Ore is the 
hobbitsâ€™ form of the name given at that time to 
these creatures, and it is not connected at all 
with our ore, ork, applied to sea-animals of 
dolphin-kind.
